"In the early 2000s, I used Fedora Core 5, 10, and 11, but dropped it for Windows XP and Windows 7. Between Windows, I tried out OpenSUSE, Linux Mint, and a few other distros before going back to macOS and Windows. I've been running Ubuntu as my primary operating system for the last year. I'm very comfortable and happy with it. I've even created bash scripts to set up and configure my system with a single command.

But, for this class, I'd like to try Arch Linux. I've heard many good things about it recently, and a rolling distribution sounds interesting and different from Ubuntu."
