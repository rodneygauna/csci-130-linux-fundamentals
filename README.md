## Getting Started

To use this repository:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Navigate through the weekly folders for chronological content
3. Check the Week folders for lecture notes, assignments, and lab work
4. Large data files (like log files) are excluded via `.gitignore` for GitHub compatibility
